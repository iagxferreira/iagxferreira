# Hello, It's a pleasure to have you here!!

I am a developer passionate about distributed service applications.

I started learning to program when I was 16. At that time I was looking for something that wouldn't bore me and would help me earn some money. Today I have found my sparky.

I am currently working as a Senior Systems Analyst at the largest investment bank in Latin America while trying to graduate from college.

Lately I have been learning and researching about systems architecture, scalability, design patterns and team leadership.

I am always ready for new opportunities and challenges in my career. Talk to me about hobbies, clean code, clean architecture, professional development or mental health, I'm sure we'll have a good conversation.
