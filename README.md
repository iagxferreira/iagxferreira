# Hello, It's a pleasure to have you here!!

I am a developer passionate about distributed service applications who learned how to program when I was 16.

On that occasion, I was looking for something that wouldnâ€™t bore me and would help me make some money and today I have found my sparky.

Nowadays, I am working as a Specialist Software Engineer focused on financial services.

Lately, I have been learning and researching systems architecture, scalability, and design patterns to get better at tech team leadership.

I am always up to new opportunities and challenges in my career. Artificial intelligence, professional development, self improvement and mental health are such things I like to discuss. Send me an email and schedule a meeting. Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ll have a friendly conversation.
